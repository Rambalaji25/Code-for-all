Split Odometer - K Seconds
The program must accept a string S containing only digits as the input. The length of the string S is always divisible by 3. The string S represents the state of a split odometer which runs based on the following conditions.
- Every three digits in the odometer represent a value or parameter.
- Every second, every 3rd digit in the odometer increases by 1.
- Once the 3rd digit reaches 0, then the 2nd digit in the odometer increases by 1.
- Once the 2nd digit reaches 0, then the 1st digit in the odometer increases by 1.
The program must print the state of the odometer for the next K seconds from the given state as the output. The value of K is also passed as the input.

Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= Length of S <= 99
1 <= X <= 10^4

Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains K.

Output Format:
The first K lines contain the state of the odometer for the next K seconds from the given state.
