There are N trees planted circularly in a ground. Every day, the gardener will cut down X trees circularly so that the height of each tree will be reduced by 1. Similarly, each tree will grow, thus increasing the height by 1 each day (The trees cut down by the gardener will not grow on that day). If the height of a tree is 1, then he cannot cut down the tree even if it is present in the X trees that he wants to cut down. The program must accept N integers representing the height of N trees and the value of X as the input. The program must print the height of the N trees after T days. The value of T is also passed as the input to the program.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X <= N <= 100
1 <= T <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N integers separated by a space.
The third line contains X and T separated by a space.

Output Format:
The first line contains the height of the N trees after T days separated by a space.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
5
10 7 5 8 6
3 4

Output:
8 5 5 8 6

Explanation:
Here X = 3 and T = 4.
Initially, the height of the 5 trees are 10 7 5 8 6.
After day 1, the height of the 5 trees become 9 6 4 9 7.
After day 2, the height of the 5 trees become 8 7 5 8 6.
After day 3, the height of the 5 trees become 9 6 4 7 7.
After day 4, the height of the 5 trees become 8 5 5 8 6.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
8
8 2 4 1 9 8 8 7
5 7

Output:
5 1 1 2 8 7 7 6

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
3
4 2 7
3 3

Output:
1 1 4

#Your code below
d=int(input())
f=list(map(int,input().split()))
v,G=map(int,input().split())
j=0
for x in range(G):
    h=[]
    for p in range(v):
        h.append(j%d)
        j+=1
    for k in range(d):
        if k in h:
            if f[k]!=1:
                f[k]-=1
        else:
            f[k]+=1
print(*f)
