The program must accept a string S that indicates the input of the keys entered on a keyboard. In the string S, each hyphen represents a backspace key. The program must modify the string S by performing the function of the backspace key. Then the program must print the modified string S as the output. If there are no alphabets after performing the function of backspace key in the string S, the program must print -1 as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skill----rack

Output:
srack

Explanation:
In the string skill----rack, four hyphens (backspace keys) have occurred. So four characters entered before them are removed from the string.
Hence the output is srack

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
ab---d-monky-ey

Output:
monkey

Example Input/Output 3:
Input:
sdk---file----

Output:
-1

#Your code below
d=input().strip()
k=[]
for z in d:
    if z=='-':
        if k:
            k.pop()
    else:
        k.append(z)
if k:
    print(*k,sep='')
else:
    print(-1)
