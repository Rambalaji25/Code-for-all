The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must form an integer X by rotating the each digit 180 degrees based on the following conditions.
- The digits 2 and 5 rotate to each other.
- The digits 6 and 9 rotate to each other.
- For the remaining digits (0, 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8), they remain the same.
Finally, the program must print the sum of N and X as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= N <= 10^8

Input Format:
The first line contains N.

Output Format:
The first line contains the sum of N and X.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
10672

Output:
21647

Explanation:
Here N = 10672.
After rotating each digit by 180 degrees, the integer becomes 10975.
The sum of 10672 and 10975 is 21647.
So 21647 is printed as the output.

Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
5599

Output:
7865

#Your code below
f=input().strip()
g=''
for i in f:
    if i=='2':
        g+='5'
    elif i=='5':
        g+='2'
    elif i=='9':
        g+='6'
    elif i=='6':
        g+='9'
    else:
        g+=i
print(int(f)+int(g))
