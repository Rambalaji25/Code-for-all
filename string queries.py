The program must accept a string S and Q queries as the input. The query can be S+X or X+S where X is an integer. For each query, the program must modify the string S based on the following conditions.
- If the query is S+X, then the program must append the last X characters to the same string.
- If the query is X+S, then the program must prepend the first X characters to the same string.
Finally, the program must print the modified string S as the output.
Note: If there are no X characters in S to perform the append or prepend operation, then consider the entire string to perform the operation.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= X, Length of S <= 100
1 <= Q <= 50

Input Format:
The first line contains S.
The second line contains Q.
The next Q lines, each contains a query.

Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string S.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
SkillRack
5
S+1
2+S
S+4
S+1
3+S

Output:
SkSSkSkillRackkackkk

Explanation:
The given string S is SkillRack.
After the first query S+1, the string becomes SkillRackk.
After the second query 2+S, the string becomes SkSkillRackk.
After the third query S+4, the string becomes SkSkillRackkackk.
After the fourth query S+1, the string becomes SkSkillRackkackkk.
After the fifth query 3+S, the string becomes SkSSkSkillRackkackkk.
